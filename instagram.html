    <img id="insta" src="images/instagram.png" alt="instagram logo">
<p>Instagram is a free social media platform which allows users to share pictures and videos
    with other users. Its available both as a app for android and iOS and a website.</p>

    <h2>How to install:</h2>
    <p>If you are using an android or an iphone, you can simply head to the Google play store on android, or the appstore on Iphone and simply click install.</p>

    <h2>Using the app for teaching and learning:</h2>
    <div class="how"><h3 id="how">Finding Ideas</h3></div>
    <p>A great way teachers can find new and interesting ideas to use in class would be to search around on Instagram, there are many teacher and educational accounts around that can be followed and provide great ideas. Following the hashtag #teachersofinstagram will help a teacher find those accounts easily.</p>

        <div class="how"><h3 class="howA">Help Students</h3></div>
    <p>Teachers can use Instagram to help students by posting homework and reminders for projects. They can also post useful tutorials or links to useful sites that the students can use to learn. The comments section can also be used to engage the whole classroom and students can learn of one another that way too. The Direct Messages can also be useful when a student needs to ask a question relating to a post privately if they dont want to comment.</p>

        <div class="how"><h3 class="howB">Building a portfolio</h3></div>
    <p>Students can use Instagram to create a photo gallery of their photos or projects.
This gives parents, students and teachers to see their work, like and comment. It can also lead to them gaining followers that like their work and build a future portfolio and following which will be useful in the future.</p>

    <h2>Advice:</h2>
    <ul>
<li>Put your account on private. No one can view your posts unless they follow you. People can request to follow you but is it your decision whether you want them to be
    able to view your account. You also have the option to choose who can comment on your posts. Your Instagram Stories are also private.</li>

        <li>If someone is harassing you, you can always block them and report them to Instagram.</li>

        <li>When posting pictures on Instagram, you should keep in mind the location setting and the tags you use. These could easily show your location to people.</li>
    </ul>
